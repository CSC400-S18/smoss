SMOSS, or *Stonehill MOSS*, is a shell for the plagiarism detection system offered by Stanford University. This repository comprises the efforts of the Spring 2018 Computer Science Capstone class.

## Our Base:
>Moss (for a Measure Of Software Similarity) is an automatic system for determining the similarity of programs. To date, the main application of Moss has been in detecting plagiarism in programming classes. Since its development in 1994, Moss has been very effective in this role. The algorithm behind moss is a significant improvement over other cheating detection algorithms (at least, over those known to us).
